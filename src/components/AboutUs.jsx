            About & How It Works
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            🌙 <strong>Why this project exists:</strong> Many students,
            hostellers, and employees in Chennai struggle to find Sehri during
            Ramadan. This platform helps them locate Sehri points quickly and
            easily.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            🕌 <strong>Who can contribute:</strong> Any Masjid, organization, or
            individual providing Sehri can register or update their location to
            help the community.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            🤝 <strong>How it helps:</strong> Users can see up-to-date Sehri
            locations, timings, and services (Free / Paid / Dine-in / Delivery),
            ensuring no one misses their Sehri. Contributors also get
            recognition for supporting the community.
